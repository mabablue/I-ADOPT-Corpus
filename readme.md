I-ADOPT Corpus
----
This repository is used to create a corpus of valid I-ADOPT representations to be used in benchmark studies. The dataset contains 102 variables modeled by Barbara Magagna (ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2195-3997) and Chalk Stuart  (ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0703-7776) according to the [I-ADOPT Ontology](https://i-adopt.github.io/). The I-ADOPT framework is designed to facilitate interoperability between existing variable descriptions.
